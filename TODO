- add template functionality to @expose - use buffet?
- add content_type functionality to @expose -- automatic json marshalling?
- auth
- rewrite ?
- sessions ?
- db connection management -- there is already a hook, and I'm not sure 
  there is any reason for special services for this.
- stml buffet plugin

# if we move away from requiring writing a top-level script:
- per request middleware composition (would be useful anyway)
- services 
- bootstrap (load configuration from somewhere, load services)
- paster-type script for creating instances.
- swpython-like script that loads the application environment (with configuration).

- skunk.net -- the old daemon or variant thereof;
  wrappers around flup, cherrypy, paste, wsgiref;
  mod_skunkweb support.


TESTING:
- try embedding in pylons.
- use webtest for tests.
 
My examples are just development artifacts, should replace with better ones later.
