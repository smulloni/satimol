- Improve buffet support by providing reasonable default template
  options for each engine I've tested.
- test TurboKid, TurboCheetah, jinja.

For first alpha release:

- document what exists:
  - better README
  - a manual (not just STML)
  - better website (should be skunk.web driven, at least in part)
- a few more examples

---------

Then:

- application-specific configuration -- separate docroots for
  applications, for instance, or application-specific configuration
  overrides.  This can be done by an application adding a key to the
  environ in the new PreConfigHook and scoping on it.
- auth
- rewrite ?
- sessions 
- resource management -- perhaps use separate hooks
- skunk.net -- the old daemon or variant thereof;
  wrappers around flup, cherrypy, paste, wsgiref;
  mod_skunkweb support.


if we move away from requiring writing a top-level script:

- per request middleware composition (would be useful anyway)
- bootstrap (load configuration from somewhere, load services)
- paster-type script for creating instances.
- swpython-like script that loads the application environment (with configuration).



TESTING:
- try embedding in pylons.
- use webtest for tests.
