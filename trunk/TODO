- Improve buffet support by providing reasonable default template
  options for each engine I've tested.
- test TurboKid, TurboCheetah.

For first alpha release:

- document what exists:
  - better README
  - a manual (not just STML)
  - better website (should be skunk.web driven, at least in part)
- a few more examples

---------

Then:

- application-specific configuration -- separate docroots for
  applications, for instance, or application-specific configuration
  overrides.  "Application" should go into the scope environ, and
  there should be a way of specifying it -- one per context manager?
  An application manager?  (This might also mean, by the way, that the
  vfs would need to be introduced, because we'd back in the situation
  of having product archives (eggs in this case) that might be
  zipped.)  Without representing apps in this way, it is still
  possible to have multiple ones, and to scope on the basis of path or
  some other feature that distinguishes app
- auth
- rewrite ?
- sessions 
- resource management -- perhaps use separate hooks
- skunk.net -- the old daemon or variant thereof;
  wrappers around flup, cherrypy, paste, wsgiref;
  mod_skunkweb support.


if we move away from requiring writing a top-level script:

- per request middleware composition (would be useful anyway)
- bootstrap (load configuration from somewhere, load services)
- paster-type script for creating instances.
- swpython-like script that loads the application environment (with configuration).



TESTING:
- try embedding in pylons.
- use webtest for tests.
