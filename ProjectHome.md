This is the project page for _skunk.web_, a new and largely rewritten version of the SkunkWeb web application framework. It is written as a series of libraries, which can be used independently or from within other frameworks.

Highlights include:

  * `skunk.cache`, a useful cache for memoization.
  * `skunk.config`, a configuration system which keeps configuration in Python, rather than using INI files or XML.
  * `skunk.stml`, an implementation of STML (Skunk Template Markup Language).  Includes a [Buffet](http://projects.dowski.com/projects/buffet) plugin.
  * `skunk.web`, WSGI applications implementing STML active pages and an MVC framework.

Right now this is alpha code with incomplete test coverage and not much documentation.

_skunk.web_ is available either under a New BSD License or under GPL 3.
